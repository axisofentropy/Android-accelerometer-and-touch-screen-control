This version of the application collects accelerometer, orientation, and touch screen data from an Android device's sensors. Currently this is compiled for Android API version 8 (Android system version 2.2).

FAQS:

Q: Why doesn't it connect?
A: Make sure you are using the correct IP address and port number of the computer that is running the server. You should also only use a LAN IP (not the WAN).

Q: The touch-screen panning sometimes doesn't work, why?
A: When you try to pan, start the motion on a part of the screen that is not a button. Otherwise no motion information will be sent.

Q: Where can I get the server application?
A: The server is written for linux systems, and you can download it here: https://github.com/reesebutler/Android-accelerometer-and-touch-screen-control/tree/master/server

Q: The server doesn't run, why? 
A: Make sure that the file called "server" is executable. If it still does not work, try recompiling the server application. To do this, open a terminal window, navigate to the directory of the downloaded server files, and type "make server".
